- 👋 Hi, I’m Colin.
- 👀 I’m interested in getting to the reality of what data is saying and help people make decisions based on that reality.
- 🌱 I’m currently building my coding skills in Python, SQL for data analytics following a Data Analyst Bootcamp by DataScientest.com.
- 🌱 I'm also committed to furthering my understanding of Machine Learning modelisation and application deployment.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that can help organisations move forward positively and help me learn new stuff.
- 📫 You can contact me at nilocprahs@hotmail.com
